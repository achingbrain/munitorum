## Questions

### NetEA AU

#### Space Marine Legions

- Iron Warriors Iron Circle stats are missing
- Vindicator Demolisher Cannon is missing Disrupt rule compared to Leman Russ Demolishers, Legion Fellblades etc

#### Titan Legions

- The Laser Burner Battle Titan Weapon should be AND instead of OR like other weapons with both assault and small arms profiles

#### Imperial Militia

- How many upgrades can Imperial Militia units take?
- Do extra Militia Auxiliary units added via the 'Militia Auxiliary' upgrade have to have the same weapons as the other Militia Auxiliary units in the Militia Infantry Squad (eg. rifles or pistols/cc weapons)?
- If the army includes a Force Commander and only Rogue Psykers (not Discipline Masters), does the first Rogue Psyker have to be in the same formation as the Force Commander?
- Auxilia Baneblade Demolisher Cannon has no Small Arms firepower (though has AND (15 cm) range so looks like it's just been missed off)
- Auxilia Baneblade Demolisher Cannon is missing the Disrupt rule compared to the ones on Auxilia Malcador Annihalators and Leman Russ Demolishers

#### Mechanicum Taghmata

- Mechanicum Avenger Strike Fighters and Primaris Lighting have no entry in the Mechanicum Taghmata Reference List - are they same as Imperial Militia/Solar Auxilia?

#### Knight Households

- Since the Questoris Knight-Magaera/Styrix's Twin Linked Rad Cleansers have 15cm range should they be Small Arms?
- Knight Households have no limit on Lords of War points
- Questoris is sometimes spelt Questorius

#### Solar Auxilia

- Solar Auxilia Baneblade Demolisher Cannon has different profile to the Imperial Militia version
- Solar Auxilia Baneblade Demolisher Cannon is missing the Disrupt rule compared to the ones on Auxilia Malcador Annihalators and Leman Russ Demolishers
- Solar Auxilia Super Heavy Tanks are 200 points, Imperial Militia versions are 300 points

### Imperious Dominatus

#### Legiones Astartes

- What statline do Veteran Tactical Stands use?  The regular Tactical Stand with the 'Veteran' special rule?
- What statline do Breacher Centurions/Decurions use?
- The Grand size Legion Malcador Assault Companies, Legion Predator Assault Companies and Legion Sicaran Strike Companies have the same break points as the regular ones, was this intentional?
